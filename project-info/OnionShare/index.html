  <h1>üßÖ OnionShare Project Info</h1>
<h2>Info</h2>
<p>OnionShare is an open-source application for secure, anonymous file sharing, website hosting, and chatting using the Tor network. Catering to whistleblowers, journalists, activists, and those in censorship-heavy locations, OnionShare offers a user-friendly interface with features such as secure file sharing without middlemen, anonymous file receiving, on-demand OnionService for hosting static websites, and ephemeral chat rooms for off-the-record discussions. In addition, onionShare is integrated into security-focused operating systems like Qubes OS, Tails, Whonix, and Parrot OS, providing users with a comprehensive suite of private online communication and information exchange tools. The app has been localized into 12 languages, and the documentation into eight.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>OnionShare already has a large community of active users. In a recent two-week period, the Windows version received 7,833 downloads, and the macOS version 1,490 downloads. The Linux package manager Snapcraft reports 3,275 weekly active users. We don't have metrics for the Linux Flatpak version. OnionShare is built-in to several privacy-focused Linux distributions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>QubesOS</strong> - Qubes OS is a reasonably secure operating system.</li>
<li><strong>Tails</strong> - Tails is a portable operating system that protects against surveillance and censorship.</li>
<li><strong>Whonix</strong> - Whonix is software that can anonymize everything you do online.</li>
<li><strong>Parrot OS</strong> - Parrot OS is an operating system for developers and security specialists.</li>

<h2>Use Cases</h2>
<ul>
<li>As a source, I need a <strong>safe way to send files to a journalist</strong> without revealing any information about myself, so I can share important information about governmental abuse with fear of reprisal.</li>
<li>As a journalist, I need to <strong>provide sources with a trustworthy way to send information</strong> , so they have confidence that their identity will remain private.</li>
<li>As a journalist, I need a <strong>private way to chat with sources</strong> when collaborating on a story, so we can have a reliable channel for communication, while preserving their privacy.</li>
<li>As an activist, I need a <strong>safe way to publish information</strong> online without compromising my identity, so that I can help share news that isn't being covered.</li>
<li>As a user in a censorship &amp; surveillance prevalent area, I need a safe way to <strong>share sensitive documents</strong> with others.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Locations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Global</li>
<li>Areas where censorship is prevalent, including Iran, China, Russia, and Belarus</li>
</ul>
<h2>Problems we're solving</h2>
<p>Internet censorship is a growing threat around the world. 67% of people online live in countries where &quot;criticism of the government, military, or ruling family is subject to censorship.&quot; [1] Longitudinal data from OONI shows the problem is growing in China, Iran, and Russia. [2] While motivations for this behavior vary, the NY Times reports that for Russia, the goal is to &quot;gain more leverage over Western internet companies in addition to other strong-arm tactics and legal intimidation.&quot; [3] In China, people are tracked and sometimes arrested for questioning narratives from the State. An individual within China compiled this recent list (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CQBeBpP2-A45lw-zr6mneDuPtSBNWg_8KqgXpWMLcbo/edit#gid=0) of nearly 2,000 recent incidents of punishment from the government, providing relevant links to official news reports, public verdicts, and police notes. [4]</p>
<p>In Iran, for example, common sites and services like BBC News, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Signal, Netflix, and GitLab are blocked. [5] Blocks like this don't only impact consumption but also utility. It prevents people from collaborating online or hosting web content for fear of State persecution. Any cloud-based service becomes a risk.</p>
<p>On a large scale, we need more channels for getting software into countries with suppressive policies. More software should be available as local apps that do not require cloud services to function. And on a marketing and communications level, adversarial language should be avoided the threat of state censorship.</p>
<p>OnionShare is a free and open-source cross-platform application that empowers users to securely and anonymously share files, host websites, and chat with anyone. OnionShare addresses the problems of internet censorship by utilizing Tor for all network activity, circumventing any firewalls or other censorship in place, providing a highly usable app experience, and removing all technical barriers to properly configuring digital spaces that you can trust. As a result, a pro-democracy advocate in Iran can safely collaborate with someone in China without the fear of oppressive surveillance.</p>
<p>Journalists are empowered to keep sources private, lawyers to work in confidence with clients, and bloggers to publish in areas that quell sharing information and stifle free speech. In addition, the app reduces attack surfaces by running locally and requiring no technical knowledge.</p>
