# ðŸŽ¨ Penpot Resources

[Penpot](https://penpot.app) is a free and open-source web-based design and prototyping tool.

Free design resources for wireframing, persona-building, and storyboarding will be made available here. We'll also publish the design kit that we use internally for the Science & Design brand.
