  <h1><strong>ü§´ Hush Line Project Info</strong></h1>
<h2>Info</h2>
<p>Hush Line is a self-hosted secure, anonymous tip line and suggestion box designed to protect user privacy and message confidentiality. It uses PGP encryption, Tor, onion binding, HTTPS, and SMTP to ensure safe and reliable communication for journalists, employers, and educators. Hush Line is crucial in areas with internet censorship, providing users with a free and open-source platform to share sensitive info without fear.</p>

<h2><strong>Problems we're solving</strong></h2>
<p>Individuals need safe ways to communicate confidential information without fear of being compromised. Whether the sender or receiver, security, privacy, and usability are critical in establishing trust when handling confidential information.</p>
<p>Journalists and newsrooms depend on confidential communications. Geneva Overholder, a contributor to the New York Times, says, &quot;to journalism, sources are the lifeblood of newsgathering.&quot;[1] Whistleblowers risk their personal and professional reputations to expose wrongdoing, and the risks they face include imprisonment and exile. Even the families of journalists and whistleblowers have faced harassment or even detainment. [2] With such stakes, sources need confidence that they won't be burned.</p>
<p>In schools, students have entirely different expectations of trust and safety. A 16-year study of one school showed that when they implemented measures in the name of security, including metal detectors, gates, and removing decorative elements from campus, the feeling of safety went down. Peer violence increased, calls to the police quadrupled, and teachers grew increasingly concerned. [3]</p>
<p>Trust matters a lot in the workplace - in a Harvard Business Review study, individuals at high-trust companies report &quot;74% less stress, 106% more energy at work, 50% higher productivity, 13% fewer sick days, 76% more engagement, 29% more satisfaction with their lives, 40% less burnout.&quot; [4] And research from MIT shows that &quot;trusting employees are 260% more motivated to work, have 41% lower rates of absenteeism, and are 50% less likely to look for another job.&quot; And did you know that a quarter of employees do not trust their employers? [5]</p>
<p>Tools exist to facilitate trust - SecureDrop, GlobalLeaks, OnionShare. SecureDrop, for example, is actively used by organizations including The New York Times, Pro Publica, Financial Times, and many others.[6] It allows organizations to receive files from anonymous sources and is built for high-threat models. Hush Line approaches the problem differently: simplifying the feature set so that using the service helps protect both the organization and the user. Instead of accepting files requiring air-gapped computers and advanced knowledge, Hush Line is a message-only service. It focuses on building trust first by serving as the initial handshake between the two parties. The user does not have to create an account, generate keys (or even know what PGP is), or download new software.</p>
<p>The app installs with a simple wizard configuring Nginx, Tor, automatically renewing Let's Encrypt certificates, automatic updates,, and email notifications.With functionality built to satisfy high-thread model scenarios, Hush Line's experience is made to be a tool anyone can get running in minutes..</p>
