# Payment Model

Work obtained through **Science & Design** will have a 10% fee applied to cover business expenses. At the end of the (year | half-year | quarter | month), the remaining profits are distributed back to the members according to their (annual|bi-annual|quarterly|monthly) activity.

In the example below, two members have collectively earned of $300,000 over the (year | half-year | quarter | month), and one member has no earnings. Member 1's income of $100,000 is 33% of the total revenue that (year | half-year | quarter | month), and Member 3's $200,000 is 67%. This affords Science & Design $30,000 of administrative fees.

(Annual | Bi-Annual | Quarterly | Monthly) expenses total $9,000, netting $21,000.

At the end of the (year | half-year | quarter | month), Member 1 will receive $6,930, or 33% of the net income, and Member 3 will receive $14,070, totaling the net income of $21,000. The inactive member will have no funds distributed. 

Members have the options of being awarded with time credits for their work.
