# Our Vision

## Vision
We are a non-profit organization that provides free research, design, and development services to public interest causes.

## Values
- Charity
- Equity
- Relationships
- Diversity
- Mission Driven
- Privacy

## Methods
- **Charity** - We provide financial support and give our services for free whenever possible.
- **Equity** - No pay disparities. No CEOs making 6000x the median employee.
- **Relationships** - The community shapes us. Through donor, sponsor, client, or worker relationships, we hear everyone's voices.
- **Diversity** - We need diverse voices to have a balanced conversation.
- **Mission** Driven - We help make public interest organizations successful.
- **Privacy** - All customer, donor, or other information is stored securely with the principle of least-access.

## Obstacles
- **Funding** - To do free work, we need funding through grants, benefactors, client engagements, or self-funding.
- **Access** - Cold calling is hard. We're starting from scratch when expanding our business beyond people we already know.
- **Talent** - Finding people is hard. Finding people that have the same values is harder. 
- **Need** - The organizations that need tech work may already have in-house talent. Others may already have a relationship with another tech group.

## Measures
- **Money** - Have more than $0 in the bank after the first year.
- **Leads** - Generate at least one lead per week.
- **Sponsors** - Gain at least one sponsor per quarter.
- **Diversity** - At least one collaborator per content (except Antarctica) in the network after the first year.
- **Network** - Build the network to at least 100 people across all disciplines.
